# Source Data Initialization Specification for Northwind

This pull request is strictly for creating and discussing a specification for the source data initialization for Northwind with 3-day snapshot ingestion.

The specification will be written incrementally as a Markdown file named `source-data-spec.md`.

While we may note high-level implementation designs, such as the use of notebooks, detailed code implementation is not the primary focus of this pull request.
